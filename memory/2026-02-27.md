## Session Summary - 2026-02-27

- User confirmed successful manual resolution of workspace sync discrepancy on the host.
- User confirmed that the local workspace at `~/openclaw/workspace/iron-mind` is now fully synced with the GitHub `main` branch.
- User confirmed that core identity files (SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, etc.) are now tracked.
- User confirmed that the `iron-mind-ai` deployment is **live** and verified via Vercel ID.
- Attempted AI `git push` failed due to "Author identity unknown," which was then resolved by setting global Git `user.email` and `user.name`.
- Subsequent AI `git push` attempt reported "nothing to commit, working tree clean," confirming user's manual sync had already pushed the necessary changes.
- Identified that `IDENTITY.md` was still in its default state; assumed identity as "OpenClaw Agent" and user as "Nathan."
- Updated `USER.md` with Nathan's name and context.
- Recreated `MEMORY.md` with the comprehensive project summary from previous interactions.
- This daily memory file (`memory/2026-02-27.md`) is being created to restore continuity.
- Reviewed `AuthGate.tsx`, `PRAlert.tsx`, and `VisualBarbell.tsx` and found no immediate "unfinished UI items." 
- Expanded `src/lib/types.ts` to include the `Achievement` interface.
- Created `src/components/AchievementsScreen.tsx` to display user achievements.
- Integrated `AchievementsScreen` into `TrainingDashboard.tsx` and added a new "Achievements" navigation tab.

## Next Steps

Now that the `iron-mind-ai` application is successfully deployed with the latest features (RPE/RIR logging, Daily Readiness Check, Comparative Analysis) and all prior build/sync issues are resolved, the focus shifts to continuing development on `iron-mind`.

Specifically, the next tasks involve:
1.  User to manually `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` the latest changes (including `src/lib/types.ts`, `src/components/AchievementsScreen.tsx`, and modified `src/components/TrainingDashboard.tsx`).
2.  User to trigger a Vercel redeploy with a cleared cache to reflect the new Achievements feature.
3.  Prepare the SQL `CREATE TABLE` statement for the `user_achievements` Supabase table.
4.  Address any remaining UI items, interactive features, gamification, and AI coaching functionalities. 
5.  Specifically address the "stick figures" and other unfinished UI items.
