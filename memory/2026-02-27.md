## Session Summary - 2026-02-27

- **Lift Figure Enhancements:** All four `LiftFigure` SVGs (`SquatFigure`, `BenchFigure`, `DeadliftFigure`, `PressFigure`) in `src/components/LiftFigure.tsx` were successfully refined for a more anatomically stylized appearance.
- **Lift Percentage Display:** Implemented the display of lift percentages on the train tab. This involved:
    - Modifying `src/components/SetRow.tsx` to accept a `percentage` prop and display it.
    - Updating `src/components/TrainingDashboard.tsx` to calculate the percentage for each `workoutSet` and pass it to the `SetRow` component.
    - Resolved a `Type error: Cannot find name 'percentage'` by correctly destructuring the `percentage` prop in `SetRow.tsx`.
- **SOUL.md Overhaul:** The `SOUL.md` file was extensively updated with new persona guidelines, strong opinions, brevity rules, allowances for wit and swearing, and a comprehensive "Advanced Operating Principles" section, replacing the previous content.
- **MEMORY.md Edit Troubleshooting:** Encountered persistent issues with `edit` tool due to exact string matching requirements. Ultimately resolved by reading the entire file, internally modifying the content, and then overwriting `MEMORY.md` with the updated version.
- **Vercel Deployment:** User successfully committed and pushed changes, and confirmed a successful Vercel build after the `SetRow.tsx` fix.
