# ⚖️ Iron-Mind AI: Legal Compliance & IP Strategy

## 1. The Jim Wendler / 5/3/1 IP Assessment
The term "5/3/1" is a registered trademark of Jim Wendler. The specific training templates (e.g., "Boring But Big") are protected intellectual property. However, **mathematical principles and percentage-based periodization** cannot be copyrighted.

### ✅ Strategy: The "Clean Room" Approach
To protect the business from legal action (Cease & Desist):
- **Naming:** We will avoid using "5/3/1" in the primary marketing. We will refer to the method as **"The Core Protocol"** or **"Dynamic Strength Ratios."**
- **Attribution:** We will include a respectful attribution in the "Settings" page: *"Calculations inspired by the work of Jim Wendler."*

## 2. Liability Disclaimer (Essential for iPhone App)
Every fitness app requires a "hold harmless" agreement. I have drafted the following to be included in our onboard flow:

> *"Iron-Mind AI provides physical training data for educational purposes. Consult a physician before starting any high-intensity program. You agree to use this information at your own risk and hold Iron-Mind AI harmless for any injury sustained during training."*

## 3. Code Ownership (AI Patents)
As discussed, the **Patentable Value** lies in our unique PR Prediction algorithm and the "Visual Barbell" UX.
- We will file for a **Trademark** on the name **"Iron-Mind AI"** once Phase 2 begins.
