# Task: Analyze healthguard-ai directory for potential actions (no execution)

## Plan:
1. List the contents of the `healthguard-ai` directory to understand its structure.
2. Based on the contents, report back what I *could* do with it, but *not* perform any actions.
3. Wait for explicit instruction to proceed with any action.
